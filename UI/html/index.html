                <p>
                    Since the rise of the internet, more people have switched their attention from spending hours
                    watching TV and listening to the radio or even reading newspapers to scrolling and tapping on
                    their phones and laptops. Businesses can now reach more eyeballs online than the more
                    traditional approaches.
                </p>
                <p>
